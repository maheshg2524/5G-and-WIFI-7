                        What is Wifi 7:-
                        Wi-Fi 7 is the latest generation of wireless technology, it is
                        the successor to Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E. It's designed to provide faster speeds,
                    </div>
                    <div class="wifi-intro same">
                        When Wifi 7 is introduced :-
                        The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7 program
                        on January 8, 2024, making Wi-Fi 7 official. However,
                        the final ratification is not expected until the end of 2024
